## Introduction

This Java application is built on the Spring-Boot framework! This project interacts with Discord commands or startup objects in the application.yml to monitor NFT listings and write them to a Discord channel, see *How-TO* below for more details.

## Setup
### Application.yml Setup
The following document formatting MUST REMAIN THE SAME, replace or add only where noted to!
Tips:
* You MUST have this Discord bots role above `LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH`.
* The position of the `discord` and `listings` items below `nft-bot` are essential!

``` yaml
# Custom
nft-bot:
  apiKeyOpensea: <Required for runtime>
  discordÂ¹:
    token: <DISCORD-TOKEN>
    commandPrefix: <DISCORD-COMMAND-PREFIX>
  listings:
    - contractAddress: <PLACE A ERC-721 CONTRACT ADDRESS>
      interval: <PLACE INTERVAL IN MS: EX. 30000 = 30 SECONDS>
      server: <PLACE SERVER NAME WHERE OUTPUT WILL GO>
      enableHolders*: <boolean to enable the next value>
      holdersOutputChannelId*: <Discord channel id>
    - [...] <CAN SUPPORT INFINITE LISTINGS>
    
(*) = is optional
```

### Running the Project

Executing the project can be done in two ways, the first is by initializing using Maven which the second produces a traditional Jar file. Before attempting to run the program some setup must be done inside of the [src/main/resources/application.properties](src/main/resources/application.yml), you can follow the guides.

### Build with Maven

If you have Maven installed on your machine you can navigate to the root project directory with this README file and execute the following. Remember to follow the above Database setup procedures first.
```sh
mvn -B -DskipTests clean package
```
You can also use the built in Maven wrapper and execute the project by following this command.
```sh
./mvnw -B -DskipTests clean package
```
### Setting up in IDE

Download Lombok to your IDE or VS Code Extension!

### Creating a Docker Image

To build a container that can execute the application from a safe location you can use my supplied [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) to do so. You should follow the guides first to better understand some of these arguments.

```Dockerfile
CMD [ "java", \
        "-jar", \
        "discord-nft-bot.jar"]
```
